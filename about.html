	<p>PERSONAL & PROFESSIONAL BIO
A bit of my personal story:
 
I grew up in Berkeley, CA in the 1980'sn & '90s.  Some identities I have are: white, cis-gender female, queer.   As a child, I was very sensitive and I remember doing group work from an early age.  I used to make up performances for my parents' friends, I always wanted to play group games and have fun. I even remember setting up my stuffed animals in a circle and talking to them.  Now, as a therapist & group facilitator in the UNtraining, I get to be with people for a living!  I love to ask people, "what did you just naturally do as a child?  what games did you like to play?"  Sometimes that can give us lots of info about who we are and what we want in life.
 
In my life, I have experienced several traumas that left me with feelings of mistrust, numbness, hypervigilance & shame/guilt.  I have experienced depression, anxiety, and intense anger.  I have also experienced great joy, gratitude and spritiual connection with life and beauty of the world around us.  I have committed my life to building safe spaces for people to rebuild trust and a sense of belonging - experiences I believe are intensely lacking in our modern, product-oriented culture.   I believe that all people are connected, we have all experienced difficulties and it is up to us to create asupportive network for each other.  How do we do this?  By working on our own healing while simultaneously working to build community with others.  It is because of this strong belief I require that anyone working with me also be working in community.   
 
What can I expect from you as a Therapist?
 
In everything I do personally and profesionally, I see myself first as a member of a community.  I carry a deep love for people and for the planet, and have centered my life around doing whatever I can to help heal the pain in our society.  Over the years, I have come to believe in the power of each of us to learn to work with ourselves and our own strengths & limitations, and that becoming aware of our true selves existing inside of societal conditioning is a powerful tool to give us the strength to work toward a better society.
 
When I work as a Therapist Therapy is one interest I have pursued because of my curiousity about how people survive terrible experiences.  What causes some people to thrive while others struggle so desparately? 
I seek to help those who are passionate about social justice, ready to form community, and who are interested in what it takes to generate a sense of belonging – first from inside yourself and then to extend out to others.  And then to participate in becoming leaders to create safe spaces in society.
 
As a social justice & community-oriented therapist, I am always asking : “how does each person's individual healing relate to building a more supportive & equitable society?  I believe there is an intimate relationship between our own healing and the healing of society, and look forward to exploring this question with you.
 
I believe strongly that community work is central to social change, and because of this I work exclusively with those whowho are currently participating in a group of some sort that is working on social justice issues.  Examples include:
Process groups exploring internalized oppression or white supremacy conditioning
Activist / Organizing groups
Non-profit work environments
 
If you would like to work with me and do not currently participate in any sort of group work, I encourage you to check the "Resources" page and would be glad to talk with you about what group might be best for you.
